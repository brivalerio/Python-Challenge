# Python-Challenge

Python Challenge included 2 excercises that encompassed real-world situations were completed using the Python scripting skills we learned in previous weeks.

PyBank<br/>
In this challenge, a Python script was created for analyzing the financial records of a company. Provided, was a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The simple dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

The script analyzed the records and calculated teh following:<br/> 
-The total number of months included in the dataset<br/>
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period<br/>
-The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period<br/> 
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period<br/> 
-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period<br/>
>>>
The script both printed the analysis to terminal and exported a text file with results.

PyPoll<br/>
